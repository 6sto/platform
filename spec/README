# debugging note: you can do this for spec testing debugging:
#
# 1) add set this to true in spec_helper.rb
#
#	Capybara::Screenshot.autosave_on_failure = true
#
# 2) write this in a spec
#
#	screenshot_and_save_page
#
# A screenshot and the HTML of the page will be dumped in tmp/capybara/ with a timestamp
